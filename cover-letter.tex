\textbf{Application for Data Scientist – Traveler Role}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.025cm}

\begin{justify}

With great interest, I read the job posting for a Data Scientist position in 
the Traveler Data Products Team at GetYourGuide. As a Data Science graduate 
student at the Berliner Hochschule für Technik (BHT) with hands-on experience 
in machine learning, natural language processing, and backend development, I 
think that I might be a suitable candidate for this position. I am deeply 
passionate about building data-driven systems that scale and serve meaningful 
customer needs.
\\
\\
In my recent research role at BHT's Cognitive Algorithms Lab, I not only 
developed a pseudonymization model for German texts based on the mT5 model, 
but also implemented a lightweight web-based application that made it easy for 
users to interact with the system. This end-to-end tool—deployed as a REST API 
with a Streamlit interface on a Kubernetes cluster—demonstrates my ability to 
quickly prototype functional data products that can be readily used by 
researchers and practitioners alike. I also co-authored a peer-reviewed paper 
related to this research accepted at AiMH 2025.
This project deepened my technical knowledge of NLP, Flair, PyTorch and many 
other tools, as well as enhanced my understanding of privacy-sensitive data 
workflows and inspired to build scalable machine learning deployment.
Prior to that, I optimized automation pipelines for statistical factsheets 
generation at Solactive AG, reducing delivery latency by 90\% using Python, 
Docker and Rundeck.
These experiences shaped my strong ML, NLP, and software engineering skills, 
all rooted in an end-to-end product thinking mindset.
\\
\\
I have extensive experience with Python, SQL, PyTorch, and modern ML 
libraries, as well as a solid understanding of statistical methods, hypothesis 
testing, and data visualization. My interest in recommender systems, LLMs, and 
personalization strategies aligns closely with the mission of the Traveler 
team.
I am a proactive, team-oriented individual who values clear communication and 
continuous learning.
I would be delighted to contribute my expertise and motivation to your diverse 
and interdisciplinary team and to help shape the future of travel experience 
through intelligent data products.
\\
\\
Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be pleased to have 
the opportunity to discuss my background and your expectations in a personal 
conversation.
